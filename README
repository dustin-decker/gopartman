gopartman
-----------

This package is designed to manage Postgres partitions and borrows (as in, makes best efforts to keep up to date with) SQL from the wonderful 
(pg_partman)[https://github.com/keithf4/pg_partman] extension for Postgres. Only, this package is not installing an extension into the Postgres database.

Instead, this package is meant to build a binary which can be daemonized to run and constantly monitor and manage your Postgres partitions given 
instructions by you. It is configurable. It can also be brought into another package for use there as well and need not run by itself. Just keep 
in mind that there are regular tasks that need to be performed to manage your Postgres partition tables.
